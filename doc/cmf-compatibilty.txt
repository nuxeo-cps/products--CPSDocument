CMF compatibility :
--------------------

CPSDocument works just fine within a 'stock' CMF instance now.

Actually tested with CMF-1.4.7

DEPENDENCIES :
---------------

Here are the mandatory products for CPSSchemas within the CMF:

 - CPSSchemas > 0.29.0

 - CPSInstaller (Used for the installation only)
   You can launch the intaller through the CMFQuickInstaller though.

 - Epoz 7.4

 - TranslationService >= 0.5.0

 - Localizer = 1.0.1

 - PortalTransforms -> CVS Nuxeo : http://cvs.nuxeo.com (didn't the test the
   logilab version for a while so we can't say anything about it)

Localizer and TranslationService are still here because of the skins.  It
can be successfully installed without though but the widgets are going to be
broken.

TESTS on a 'stock' CMF :
-------------------------

You can launch tests against CPSDocument within the tests
sub-directory. You'll need for that Localizer and TranslationService

Simply go to the test directories and type :

 $ make test
