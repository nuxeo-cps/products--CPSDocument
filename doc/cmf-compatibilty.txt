CPSDocument works just fine within a 'stock' CMF instance now.

Actually tested with CMF-1.4.7


Dependencies
============

Here are the mandatory products for CPSSchemas within the CMF:

- CPSSchemas > 0.29.0

- CPSInstaller (Used for the installation only)

  You can launch the installer through the CMFQuickInstaller
  though.

- Epoz 7.4

- TranslationService >= 0.5.0

- Localizer = 1.0.1

- PortalTransforms -> CVS Nuxeo: http://svn.nuxeo.org/
  (didn't the test the logilab version for a while so we can't say
  anything about it)

Localizer and TranslationService are still here because of the
skins.  It can be successfully installed without though but the
widgets are going to be broken.


Tests on a 'stock' CMF
======================

You can launch tests against CPSDocument within the tests
sub-directory. You'll need for that Localizer and
TranslationService

Simply go to the test directories and type::

    $ make test
