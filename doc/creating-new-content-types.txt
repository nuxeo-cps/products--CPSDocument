No, that's true. However, it's quite easy.

You create a schema in portal_schemas. Say, "Foo". Just put in all fields
you want. For CPSDocuments I think title and description are required, but I
don't remember 100%.

Then you create a layout (use the same name to lesser confusion) in
portal_layouts. Here you add all the fields again, but now you choose how
they should be displayed by using different WidgetTypes.
Then you go to the Layout Tab, where you add the widgets to the layout, so
they get displayed.

Finally, you create a new CPS Flexible Type in portal_types, and set it to
use the schema and layout you created before.

That is basically it. If you get into any troubles, ask. I have probably
forgotten lot's of details.
