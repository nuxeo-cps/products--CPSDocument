    - NuxDocument

    - NuxCPSFlexibleDocument

    - NuxCPSFlexibleDocument2

    Not abstract enough. Lack easy TypesTool creation. Not enough
    abstraction of form processing and layout. Not useable for
    extensible metadata.

  Formulator

    - http://www.zope.org/Members/faassen/Formulator

    Not oriented toward having extensible instances. Too much oriented
    toward form generation. No abstraction of layout.

  CMFTypes

    - http://plone.org/documentation/CMFTypesBook

    - http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/collective/CMFTypes/

    Oriented toward code generation, not TTW document type creation.
    Types are not extensible. Presentation and validation are confused.
    There is no abstraction of the layout.

    Has an interesting concept of text transformations but this is mixed
    deeply in the validation code instead of being an entirely different
    tool.

  Flexible Metadata patch

    - http://www.gocept.com/opensource/projects/CMF_Metadata

    Only does flexible metadata.

  Bricolage

    - http://www.bricolage.cc

    - http://www.masonbook.com/book/appendix-d.mhtml

    Not a Zope product. Does interesting stuff.
