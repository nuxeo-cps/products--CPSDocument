Bug fixes:

- Added the "workflow" class to the document edit form so that comments have the
  same style as those in CPSDefault.
- Better comments field + help on the document modification form.
- Use CMFCore.permissions instead of CMFCore.CMFCorePermissions to avoid
  warnings.
New internal features:

- Added a "documentFields" class to group together the fields pertaining to a
  document. This is a stricter grouping scheme than the one defined by the
  "group" class.
- Modified metadata schema to make only Title and Description fields be indexable
  by SearchableText.
- Added the posibility of having a search box inside all the pages/chapters of
  a book document.
