- #889: flexible fields are now all suffixed with _fn with n starting from 0:
  this avoids name conflicts between static and flexible fields make it easier to
  understand what is flexible and what is not.
  Furthermore, in case of attribute storage of binary files (images, attached
  files, usw): now  use the manage_delObjectMethod instead of delattr to clean then
  on flexible field deletion so as to avoid leaving rubbish in the _objects
  attribute. This fixes a bug that was semi-hidden by the first one.
