Requires:

New features:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-
Bug fixes:
~~~~~~~~~~
- Fix zip archive import: crashed if the zip contained filenames with accented
  characters
- Provided migration script for Document type instances. In CPS3.4.0 they are
  "flexible".
New internal features:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Move widget selector from right to left in flexible documents
- Changed 'action' in cpsdocument_edit_ajax.py script from 'cpsdocument_view'
  to 'view' to profit from aliases when used for different type of object
  than Document.
- Modified cpsdocument_edit.py script to use aliases for action.
- field value IO now supports the purge="False" param for sequence values in a
  similar way as PropertyHelpers does for sequence-like properties.
